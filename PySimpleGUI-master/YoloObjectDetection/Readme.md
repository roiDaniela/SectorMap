# PySimpleGUI openCV YOLO Deep Learning

## Running the Demos
  
You will need to pip install openCV and PySimpleGUI
```
pip install opencv-python
pip install pysimplegui
```

Run any of the .py files in the top level directory:
```
yolo.py - single image processing
yolo_video.py Video display
yolo_video_with_webcam.py - webcam or file source. Option to write to hard drive

And you'll need the training data.  It's 242 MB and too large for GitHub:
